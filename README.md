CocoonJS Plugins
================

Ludei's plugins (also called extensions) are multiplatform Javascript APIs, that work in any of the three environments of CocoonJS: Canvas+, WebView+ and System webview.

[Visit http://doc.ludei.com/3.0.0/ where you'll find detailed documentation](http://doc.ludei.com/3.0.0/) for all of the CocoonJS javascript plugins.

Here is a list of the most common APIs you'd be interested in:

* Ads (Mopub, Chartboost, AdMob, etc...)
* Camera (Access to the camera raw data)
* Device (Device APIs to control things like the orientation of your app)
* Dialog (Native prompt and confirm dialogs)
* Motion ( Gyroscope and Accelerometer APIs)
* Multiplayer (Game Center and Google Play Games)
* Notification (Push and local notifications)
* Social ( Facebook, Google Play, Game Center)
* Store
* Touch
* WebView

We hope you find everything you need to get going here, but if you stumble on any problems with the docs or the extensions, just drop us a line at our forum (www.ludei.com) and we'll do our best to help you out.
